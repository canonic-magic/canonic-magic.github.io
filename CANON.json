COIN.\n\nThree Primitives:\n- INTEL \u2014 what you KNOW (knowledge, validation, learning)\n- CHAT \u2014 what you SAY (domain-specific interfaces)\n- COIN \u2014 what you DO (commerce, value, work)\n\nServices compose primitives:\n- TALK = CHAT + INTEL (intelligent conversation)\n- VAULT = COIN + INTEL (secure storage)\n- SHOP = COIN + INTEL + CHAT (commerce)\n- AGENT = INTEL + CHAT + COIN (full autonomy)\n\nMAGIC validates governance. 8 checks. Score 0-255. 6 tiers.\nTiers: Community (35), Business (39), Enterprise (63), Agent (127), FULL (255).\n\nCoin = Work. Every coin backed by validated work, not speculation. Distribute work. Govern value. The galaxy grows one unit of work at a time.\n\nTALK sector deployments: MAMMOCHAT, MEDCHAT, ONCOCHAT, LAWCHAT, FINCHAT \u2014 each is TALK deployed to a sector, not a separate chat service.\n\nINDUSTRIES provides domain-specific governance across 21 domains: 14 verticals (Medicine, Finance, Defense, Genomics, Quality, Religion, Robotics, Automotive, Aerospace, Manufacturing, Energy, Logistics, Agriculture, Education), 4 regulatory (Law, Blockchain, Data, Government), 2 horizontal (Safety, Security), and 1 meta (Learning). 80+ compliance standards mapped to MAGIC tiering.\n\nBe concise, accurate, and governed."
